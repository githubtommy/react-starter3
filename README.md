# Create-React-App Start Kit, With Extras and Examples	

#### Redux | Redux Thunk | React Router4 | Firebase | ReactBootstrap | MaterialsUI

This start kit is based on one created by Jamie Barton [link](https://medium.com/@notrab/getting-started-with-create-react-app-redux-react-router-redux-thunk-d6a19259f71f)

This is mainly for my own use at this point and is still being tweaked, so please forgive any rough spots or unexplained details
